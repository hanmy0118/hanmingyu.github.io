<p class="pro_intro">Team Incepxion aim to encourage office workers to stand up and move around to reduce the potential health risk. Hence we create an interactive installation named Breakfree system. Here is a just a small collection of the final products.

        <time>Week1 Beginning of this course</time>It was the start of this course. I felt pretty excited to create an interactive installation, and I can’t wait to start it.<br><br>I hope with the completion of this course I will have a deeper understanding of the design process in detail and a broader knowledge in using physical computing as a method to improve and solve everyday problems.
I look forward to collaborating with you all and excited for the exhibition at the edge.

        <time>Week2 The Inspiration</time> The painting has lots of advantages for children include express their creativity and make them feel confident. I designed a painting desk which allows children to paint with their fingers and hands. <br><br>The painting desk is composed by a desk and a projector. There are lots of illustrations of painting tools on the desk such as brushes, pencils, and eraser. Children could tap the illustration on the desk and use their finger to draw directly on the desk. Also, they painting products could be saved and uploaded to the cloud. This painting desk provides an easier and more interesting way for children to start learning painting, and I believed children would love this painting way.

        <time>Week3: World Café and Team Foundation</time> This week we hold world café session which aimed to help everyone became familiar with the inspiration products which categorized by theme. I participated in following themes, interactive space, social reflection, health aging and the new interface for the music expression. During the world café session, I got a great opportunity to listen to other’s idea and thoughts which inspired me a lot. <br><br>I choose the “playful work,” “interactive space” and “music expression” as three preferences and luckily I got my I first preference. Then I was allocated to become a team with Sivi, Darren, and Sanika. We came up a concept of “Junk Email Fighter” which let office workers remove the email icon on the screen by the hand gesture. It was only a draft and still need to be improved.

        <time>Week4: Brainstorming </time> The team starts to consider what the most annoying thing in the office is? Working stress, sitting at one place for a long time and do the same task every day was the answer. We also did some background researches, and we found that the poor working environment brought lots of adverse effect on office workers. <br><br>We improved the “junk email fighter” and changed it into a multi-used room with this function. The room’s wall is like a big screen, and there are several functionalities of this room. It could change the environment (with the projectors), video meeting with others and deal with emails by tapping the wall. We were still finding more inspirations on YouTube to refine the idea.

        <time>Week5: Refine the idea </time> According to the feedback from tutors and other students, the team realizes we have to make some improvements on the idea. There are two main questions we found in the current concept. The first one is current idea was too simple. It seemed that just buying a 3D projector could achieve the goal. Also, tapping the wall to operate the system is not interactive. It was like just projecting a tablet on to the wall. We need to aim to solve one problem (health) rather than multiple and focus on how the user interacts with the application. <br><br>According to the research, sedentary behavior has become a regular life of office workers. Hence the team came up an idea about an interactive wall which encourages office workers to do more exercises. When the user does some body movements and move around, it will be detected, and some plants like flower and trees show and grow on the screen.

        <time>Week6: Report writing</time> This week we focused on report writing and developing the idea further. We plan to give 5 minutes of each play. In the first 2.5 minutes, the user could use gesture and body movement to create a garden and in the remaining 2.5 minutes will be the user throw the stress ball and kill the plant eater on the screen. It makes the game more challenging and let the user to exercises more to reduce the risks of sedentary behavior. <br><br>Also, we were considering to use the chair with the pressure sensor to detect user’s sitting time. When someone sits for a long time, their laptop will receive a message to remind them to do some exercises.

        <time>Week7: Working on the prototype</time> We started to consider transforming the concept into a real product. I planned to use Illustrator to create some illustrations of the garden, and later I would add animations with AfterEffect. <br><br>The team thought about using Kinect to detect user’s body movement and use Unity to create the exercises system. For the pressure chair, we planned to use Makey Makey to build it.

        <time>Week8: Keep working</time> We spent a day filming some videos, and we originally planned to use this video to explain how the system works in next week’s presentation. But we later decided to keep the video for next assessment. <br><br>Also, the team chose to abandon AfterEffect to create the animation because it was too time-consuming and none of us was the master of that, and we realize the Unity3D was the best choice to do this animation. So the illustrations were made by myself have to be abandon.

        <time>Week9: Prototype Presentation</time> This week we were busy with the presentation, and other things need to be submitted on Friday. I was responsible for the background research, promotional material, and prototype demonstration part. Currently, the game interface looks like this. 
<br><br>We exported the demo as a video and insert it into the PowerPoint, but the video didn’t work during the demonstration. We can only use Darren’s laptop to demonstrate in this case. Hence it seemed that some audiences were unable to understand our concept, so we didn’t get too much useful feedback.

        <time>Week10: Change of concept</time>Since Monday’s guest lecture, we realized our idea didn’t meet the target, especially in the interaction aspect. Our concept only focused on individual exercises which mean the visitors probably wouldn't do the exercise tasks we want them to. 

<br><br>Sanika came up a brand new idea about having a wall with many objects and have the user remove the wall to reveal the image or message behind it which would say something like "do you know the dangers of sitting a long time?”. The maximum opacity of this system is four people. When more than people join, they could collaborate with others and finish the game. 

<br><br>We decided that the blocks can be different items located in an office such as printers, folders, telephones, etc. The user needs to collect the particular icon and put it into the box. During this process, if users touch the boss, they will fail the game. This game was named as "Breakfree".

        <time>Week11: User testing </time> We invited some friends and did some user testing. All the observations and feedbacks show that the game was too hard to play. The aim of our project is to encourage office workers exercises and release their stress. But now, some users think the Breakfree system make them feel confused and tired. So we need to reflect on how to make the game easier.

        <time>Week12: Get ready for the exhibition</time> The team made some improvements of the game especially on the difficulties of the game. The team went to The Edge again and tested. At this test session, we didn’t focus too much on the functionality of the game. The main purpose of this testing is to ensure anything is ready to set up. Hopefully, everything will go well in the exhibition day.
